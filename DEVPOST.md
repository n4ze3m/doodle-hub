## DoodleHub

Doodle Hub is a free and open source doodle sharing platform where you can draw and receive doodles anonymously.

## Inspiration

DoodleHub was inspired by my old project, [lol-message](https://devpost.com/software/lol-message) an  anonymous feedback application. So I decided to make a similar concept application but for doodles or drawing.

## What it does

DoodleHub is a web application that allows users to receive anonymous doodles from their peers. All users have a unique URL that they can share with their friends to receive doodles. The user can also view all the doodles they have received in the past on their dashboard.

Every time a user receives a doodle, they will receive a notification on their associated email using courier. The user can also view the doodle on their dashboard.

## How we built it

Following are the technologies used to build DoodleHub:

- FastAPI for full-stack web development
- Jinja2 for templating
- Supabase for database, storage, and authentication
- Courier for email notifications

## Challenges we ran into

This is my first time using Jinja2 with FastAPI. I had to learn how to use Jinja2 with FastAPI and how to use it to render templates.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of


Drawing board was a challenge to implement. I had to learn how to use the canvas API and how to use it to draw on the canvas. After a lot of research, I was able to implement the drawing board with some bugs.

## What we learned

Learned lots of new things while building this project. I usually use React for frontend development, but this time I used Jinja2 for templating. I also learned how to use the canvas API to draw on the canvas. 

## What's next for Doodle Hub

In future versions, DoodleHub have the following features:

- Settings page for users to manage their account
- Public Doodles page for users to view all the doodles they have received 
- Ability to delete doodles
